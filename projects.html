        <div class="mb-2">

            <h3 class="mb-1">1. QCD Phase Structure</h3>

            <p> Low energy QCD is governed by two prominent
                non-perturbative phenomena, dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and
                confinement. Both are well-incorporated in functional
                approaches to first principle QCD, see e.g.~the recent works in vacuum QCD with
                the functional Renormalisation Group (fRG) works [1,2]
                (fRG) and Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs)
                [3] in the fQCD collaboration, and the reviews [4,5].
                These computations have passed
                systematic error checks, leading to a systematic error
                estimate on observables of \(\,< 5\% - 10\%\), depending on the specific observable, see the topic
                    Systematics. Moreover, in the vacuum and finite temperature the results agree quantitatively with
                    the available lattice benchmarks. The setup also allows us to study the chiral limit and the
                    relevance of soft modes [6]. All in all this sets the stage for the application of functional
                    approaches to finite density QCD. </p>
                    <p>
                        Presently, direct computations in first principle QCD at finite density with \(\mu_B/T \gtrsim
                        4\)
                        are only possible within functional approaches. They (mostly the fRG and DSE approach) are used
                        in the fQCD
                        collaboration to map out the phase structure of QCD: we aim at the location
                        of the crossover line, that of the critical end point or more precisely the
                        onset of new phases such as the moat regime or first order regimes [7,8,9]. We also
                        aim at the computation and prediction of experimental observables such as the
                        fluctuations of conserved charges [10]. We also access realtime and dynamical properties
                        such as spectral functions [9], dynamical critical scaling [11] and transport coefficients that
                        serve, together with full effective potentials,
                        as input for hydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions [12]. This endeavour goes hand in
                        hand
                        with the systematic improvement of the approximations used in our computational framework, see
                        also
                        the topic Systematics.

            <h3 class="mb-1 mt-5">2. Thermodynamics and applications</h3>

            <p>
                The equation of state (EoS) of strong-interaction matter as a function of the temperature and density
                and
                further thermodynamic observables, such as the energy and entropy densities as well as the trace anomaly
                are of great relevance for phenomenological applications, ranging from heavy-ion collision experiments
                to neutron stars. In all these applications, an accurate computation of the EoS is key to access the
                dynamics of
                these systems. The determination of these observables requires the access of the full momentum and
                frequency
                dependence of all the propagators of QCD, and specifically that of the quarks. For other observables or
                low energy correlation this dynamical information has a sub-leading impact. A prominent example is the
                effective potential of the chiral order parameter that encodes all order scattering processes of pions.
                The independence of the latter is at the root of the unreasonable effectiveness of low energy effective
                theories
                in QCD [1,2]. The requirement of computing the full momentum and frequency dependence of the QCD
                propagators for the temperatures and densities under investigations for computing the Eos and further
                thermodynamic
                observables makes it indispensable to approach these observables within QCD itself. This allows for
                an accurate description of hot and dense matter, from perturbatively accessible regimes to
                non-perturbative
                domains governed by dynamical symmetry breaking and the formation of condensates.
                Amongst other demands and
                the general quest for smaller systematic errors, it is the requirements above that guide our systematic
                development of
                more sophistic truncations,

                In [3], we investigate the impact of strangeness neutrality on the phase structure and thermodynamics of
                QCD
                at finite baryon and strangeness chemical potential in temperature and density regimes relevant for
                heavy-ion collision experiments. In [4], we present a calculation of the zero-temperature
                equation of state over a wide range of densities. Our results indicate that the speed of sound exceeds
                the value of the non-interacting quark gas at high densities and even increases as the density is
                decreased,
                across a wide range, suggesting the existence of a maximum at supranuclear densities,
                in accordance with information extracted from neutron-star observations. In [5] we investigate the
                fluctuations of
                conserved baryon charge that are related to the chemical potential derivatives of thermodynamic
                observables.

            <h3 class="mb-1 mt-5">3. Hadronic properties </h3>

            <p>
                In functional approaches resonant scattering processes and their properties such as pole masses of the
                respective hadronic excitations are typically resolved within a combination of DSEs
                and bound state equations such as Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSE) and Faddeev equations.
                The fRG approach allows for a very efficient book keeping of resonant scattering channels as well as
                producing precision results for QCD correlation functions.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project revolves about two aspects: Firstly, we have initiated the systematic development of a
                functional
                Renormalisation Group approach to QCD which is well-adapted to studies of hadron properties
                (fRG-hadron).
                Secondly, after an initial pure development phase we use fRG-hadron for the study of non-perturbative
                properties of
                hadronic resonances. Amongst the applications are the computation of parton distribution amplitude
                (PDA) or quasi-PDA of hadrons, transverse-Momentum-Dependent Wave Functions (TMDWF) or quasi-TMDWF,
                etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                The development of fRG-hadron has been initiated in a series of work [1-3], cumulating in the setup in
                first principle QCD in [3]. Specifically, the rôle of the coupled set of the quark gap equation (DSE)
                and the BSE for the four-quark scattering kernel in the DSE-BSE formulation
                is taken over by the fRG flow of the four-quark scattering kernel and the quark propagator. This set of
                coupled flow equations is complemented by the flow of the quark-gluon vertex and the glue sector. The
                setup in [3] hosts no phenomenological parameters or external input. The only ultraviolet input
                parameters
                are the physical ones in QCD: the light and strange quark masses. They are adjusted to the physical
                ratios of
                the pion and kaon masses, divided by the pion decay constant. The results for other observables of
                current
                first-principles computations are in quantitative agreement with the physical ones. The approach is
                continuously
                developed further, drawing also from technical developments in the other project lines in the fRG
                collaboration.
            </p>

            <p>
                These developments are accompanied by further ones such as an approach for computing the valence-quark
                quasi
                parton distribution amplitude (quasi-PDA) and quasi parton distribution function (quasi-PDF) for the
                pion
                with a large longitudinal momentum [4].

            <h3 class="mb-1 mt-5">4. Sytematics</h3>

            <p>
                Functional QCD approaches build upon diagrammatic master equations for the QCD effective action.
                These master equations are one loop (fRG) or two loop (DSE) exact (figures).
                By taking derivatives with respect to the gluon, ghost, as well as quark and potential
                composite hadronic fields these master equations lead to towers of one- or two-loop exact loop
                relations between QCD correlation functions. These relations are fully non-perturbative and its
                constituents are the full n-point vertices and propagators of QCD.
                The closed form of these relations (one loop or two-loop) allows for a comprehensive access to
                systematic error estimates, see [1,2,3,4]:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b> Vertex expansion:</b> Instead of an infinite number of diagrams left out as in perturbation theory
                we typically expand this tower of relations in the number n of fields in a scattering vertex.
                Accordingly, within a given order n of this vertex expansion we are left with a finite number of
                n+1 point functions we assumed to be irrelevant and that are left out in the diagrammatic relations.
                Their impact is readily evaluated by 'dialing' their strengths within physically allowed ranges.
                Moreover, we can compute their strength within the approximation itself and test their irrelevance.
                The latter tests the self-consistency of the approximation and is only comprehensive in this sense if
                it is based on closed relations. In general, the vertex expansion converges very rapidly due to the
                phase space suppression of higher order scatterings. The only exception are resonant channels in higher
                order vertices, and the prime example are resonant channels in the four-quark scattering vertices. These
                resonant channels are accommodated with the fRG approach with emergent composites or a combination of
                bound state equations (BSE, Faddeev and four-body equations) and the DSE.
            </p>
            <b> Emergent composites and systematic error control:</b> Resonant channels in scattering vertices undo the
            otherwise generic phase space suppression of higher order vertices and lead to a slow convergence of the
            vertex expansion. These resonant channels can be captured completely by composite exchange fields and this
            is
            formulated in terms of an exact flow equation that relates the dynamics of the emergent composites and that
            of
            the resonant channels. This allows us to efficiently also capture the higher order scatterings of the
            resonant
            channels and, most importantly, restores the rapid convergence of the vertex expansion for the full tower of
            loop relations.

            <b> Derivative expansion:</b> For asymptotically small momenta, the infrared regime of QCD is
            governed by the pion dynamics, and admits a well-controlled expansion in pion scatterings,
            chiral perturbation theory. Moreover, scattering vertices can be expanded in terms of the small momentum,
            measured in the infrared mass scales of QCD. This expansion is called the derivative expansion, and its
            versatility, rapid convergence and small systematic error has been shown in many applications. These
            applications include low energy effective models of QCD, but also general condensed matter and statistical
            systems. With the LEGO principle
            these checks can be straightforwardly used in QCD.

                <b> LEGO principle [4]:</b> These checks of the systematic error of a given order of the vertex
                expansion elucidates a
                general principle behind the systematic error analysis in functional approaches, based on their
                modularity.
                The constituents in the loop relation for a given vertex can be ordered in the different sectors of
                QCD:
                the pure glue sector, the matter sector, and the interface sector connecting those two (the LEGO
                blocks).
                These sectors are only connected by a few constituents (the LEGO studs), and a separate systematic error
                analysis
                of the different sectors can be done by varying the strength of the studs. The systematic error analysis
                of the
                whole system is then constructed by combining the systematic error estimates of the different sectors.
